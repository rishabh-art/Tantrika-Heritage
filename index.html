                        Welcome to our virtual platform celebrating the variety of India's textile heritage. India's textile heritage and collection, in a word...is simply brilliant. What we wear today, are thousands of years of craftsmenship, with thousands of hands contributing, only for what we wear. What we wear, is history.

Each culture in India has a distinct and unique textile style. India's textile has diversity in culture, and it is no surprise that India's earsliest cotton thread data to around <strong>4000 B.C.</strong> In fact, India's textile were so key to its identity, that abroad, in regions like Greece and Babylon, the very name of India was shorthand for 'Cotton'!</p></div>

                            We are a team of enthusiasts working hard to preserve, aware and promote the beauty of Indian textiles to the globe. As technologies continue to emerge, these breath-taking art pieces fade away. We strongly believe the same technology threatening the foundations of the years of history and potentially challenging to fade them away, can assist to elevate them, to promote them. This is not an attempt to preserve textile; it is an attempt to preserve the memories and creativity of humanity at its richest; at India.

                    <div class="neumorphistColumn" id="greenNeumorphistColumn"><h2>Why preserve?</h2><p>
                        Well...good question! Preserving the culture is preserving the years of history. It is preserving the years of hard work and the many hands that had worked for it. It is preserving the culture we all inherit, as this culture, whether we are conscious about it or not, decide a grand set of actions and decisions that may be critical. So wouldn't it be nice to preserve this for the future generations to come, so they're aware of why they are the way they are?

                        So. The next time you open your cupboard or wherever you keep your clothes, we urge you to think about it. What you pull out of your closet, is what has evolved from the various ideologies, from the diverse cultures from more than 1000 years ago. All of that is merged, all of that has united, to a cloth for 'a new day'. And we want to ensure that this remains, that these traditional textiles don't fade as globalisation occurs. How boring would it be if everyone were the same? To help us, you can support us; and that's easy! Your small donation is casting a vote for preserving these wonders we, ourselves have created. You sharing it to your friends helps it more. We hope to see you join the revolution!
